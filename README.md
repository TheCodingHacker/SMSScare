# SMSScare

SMSScare is a project made by Geral and TheCodingHacker!

The point of the project is to use the Twilio API to make realistic looking SMS Messages to scare and troll other users.
The projects first release has just been uploaded.

# Project Requirements

To run this project currently, you will need an IDE that will run and compile python. The most basic one is Python IDLE, built into the python interpreter. Then use pip to install twilio from the public python repository.

You will also need to register to https://twilio.com to get an api key and authentication code for use with this application!

# Script Preparation

You will have to set the API Key and SID Token in the commented areas.

You will also have to change the US and UK Numbers where indicated.
